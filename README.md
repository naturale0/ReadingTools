# ReadingTools
is a set of Tools regarding to reading texts on iPhone, designed for 'Pythonista for iOS'.

You can
* calculate estimated reading time of the text
* extractively summarize the text
* locally synthesis audio file generated from the text
* remotely synthesis audio file with Google TTS, generated from the text  
(You need to run a server to communicate with Google Cloud API, though, since Pythonista cannot directly communicate with Google API)
