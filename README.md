# ReadingTools
is a set of Tools regarding to reading texts on iPhone, designed for 'Pythonista for iOS'.

You can
* `ReadingTime.py`: calculate estimated reading time of the text
* `SMRZ.py`: extractively summarize the text
* `local_TTS.py`: locally synthesize audio file generated from the text
* `gTTS_communicator.py`: remotely synthesize audio file with Google TTS, generated from the text  
(You need to run a server to communicate with Google Cloud API, though, since Pythonista cannot directly communicate with Google API)
